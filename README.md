# AdminDashboard
A Dashboard simulating my first Portfolio-Website.

# Description
This was an exercise following the "The Odin Project"-Path in becoming a web developer.

In this Project, I exercised the use of CSS Grid & CSS Flexbox, which are nested to make the Layout of the Website and the Contents. The links and button do have some animations and effects, but they lead to nowhere, as this was only an example website.
My troubles were only in the responsiveness of the Project, but I think I fairly managed to get it working just OK (for the scope of the exercise).

I know that you must think: "What are these colors? It looks like an 80s Ski-Outfit."

Yes, you are right, I had a vision with the colors which didn't work out quite as much as I liked to. Maybe there are missing shadow, maybe the choice of colors really were terrible. My getaway from this challenge is, that I shouldn't focus on becoming a web designer, I have more fun getting the layout and the logic onto the application.
